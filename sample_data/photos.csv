Anticipated Kidnapping,"In the midst of a road trip through Virginia, I decided to take a detour to avoid some construction on the highway. I was met with dense fog like sheets of floating plastic wrap. After weaving through rural farms with dark forms of giant cows looming over the road, I creeped into a foreboding Virginia State Forest. The fog, though lovely, made for not so lovely driving conditions. Nonetheless, I found myself wishing I could (safely) get out of the car with my always present nikon. Suddenly, a turn off materialized out of the mist, and I had my wish. The afternoon light diffused through the treetops opaque, yet oddly clear. As a red van emerged through the haze I knew I had my picture. Feeling a bit like Icabod Crane, I drove off deciding I had pressed my luck far enough. One never knows what's lurking in the murky woods.",12 inches x 9 inches,19.95,http://static1.squarespace.com/static/555e9fb9e4b0e15bc3f57ead/55667ab0e4b0352887a7ec99/55dfc1c6e4b02e0cd74fb2c8/1440727499055/DSC_0349+%282%29.JPG?format=500w
