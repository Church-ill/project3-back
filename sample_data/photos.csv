Anticipated Kidnapping,"In the midst of a road trip through Virginia, I decided to take a detour to avoid some construction on the highway. I was met with dense fog like sheets of floating plastic wrap. After weaving through rural farms with dark forms of giant cows looming over the road, I creeped into a foreboding Virginia State Forest. The fog, though lovely, made for not so lovely driving conditions. Nonetheless, I found myself wishing I could (safely) get out of the car with my always present nikon. Suddenly, a turn off materialized out of the mist, and I had my wish. The afternoon light diffused through the treetops opaque, yet oddly clear. As a red van emerged through the haze I knew I had my picture. Feeling a bit like Icabod Crane, I drove off deciding I had pressed my luck far enough.
